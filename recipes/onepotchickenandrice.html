    <!--Steps to make One-pot chicken and rice--> 
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the spices, garlic and oil in a large bowl and mix well. Add the chicken and turn in the mixture until well coated. Heat a large non-stick pan that has a lid, then fry the chicken, uncovered (without extra oil) over a medium-high heat for 5 mins until browned, turning the chicken halfway to brown on both sides. Remove from the pan and set aside on a plate.</li>
        <li>Pour the bouillon into the pan, stirring well to incorporate any garlicky bits that may have stuck to the base of the pan, then stir in the rice, leeks, oregano or thyme and bay, if using. Lay the chicken on top, then cover the pan and bring to the boil. Turn down the heat and simmer for 20 mins.</li>
        <li>Stir in the frozen vegetables, then cover and simmer for about 5 mins to heat through. Leave to stand for about 5-10 mins, then lightly mix and serve.</li>
    </ol>
